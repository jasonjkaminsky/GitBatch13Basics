TEAMLEAD:
view the code of planets and after checking it merge it to main branch
once the userX is done with work he will open a pull rewust to merge in 
main

---------Team Lead task------
Merge:
1. On github --> you cannot run the code and check for errors, 
you can only look at it
2. On computer --> you can test their code before merging .
-------On computer using terminal------
1. clone the project.
2. git branch -a --> shows u all the branches on github
3. git checkout branchname --> clone the branch u want
4. run the cod eof branch make sure it is error free
5. switch to parent branch
6. git merge childbranch
7. once done u can update ur main in github


--------------------------------Stashing--------------------
Requirements:
Create a car and upload it to github.
git stash -m "message"--> take the changes in code to stashing area
and  return the condition of working directory to that fo the last commit.
git stash list --> list all available stashes
git stash apply stashnumber--- > apply that stash on the intellij
Notes:
if u have made the commit in your branch
and u are trying to switch
but git doesnt allow u to switch becuase it says there are some untacked 
files that needs to be dealt
do git status to see what are those file;
if u didnot make these updates simply get rid of them
by using the command
git stash -u
and then
switch back to ur desired branch
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

* When ever u clone , by default git is going to clone only the main 
branch
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
