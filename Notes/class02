Step1: Configuring our git  (one time procedure)
-------------------
Track our first project using GIT
1. create a brand new java project
a. tell the location where our project is (naviagte to the location of 
our project using terminal)
** Initalize the repository
git init
Important concept---> Archtiecture of GIT
3-stage architecture
working directory -->the place where we have files of our project
** git status--> tells us the current status of our staging area, repo and 
working directory
untracked file--> appear in red color and it means that git is not 
tracking them right now
tracked files(in staging area)--> appear in green color
** git add filename  or git add . -->tells git which files to track
commit--> saving your file in the repository
** git commit -m "commit message"--> takes a snapshot of all files in 
staging area and save them to repo
** git log--> it shows all the commits that we have in the repo
