===== Tracking our project using git =====
1. Navigate to the location where u want to create the repository.
2. create a repo  (git init)
3. track all the files and adding them to staging area ( git add . )
4. place all files in the repository  ( git commit -m "commit message" )
git status : shows you all the untracked files in red,
tracked files that are not yet in repo by green.

In order to sync everything with remote repo do the following:
1. goto github
2. create a new repo
3. connect your local repo to the remote repo that you  just created
to make connection *git remote add origin URL
rename the branch  *git branch -M main
* u dont need these steps again for this repo*
4.push you codes to github
git push -u origin main (if you are pushing first time)
after that u can use just git push

Please take care of following steps while pushing your java project:
1. THE LOCATION OF YOUR REPO (create repo inside the proejct , not in 
any package or any class)
2. make sure that when ever you run a command , it has sucesfuuly 
executed and is not giving eroors
3. create a new github repo
4. establish the connection and recheck it using git remote -v
