Git Class 01
1. Why do we need GIT???
2. What is GIT?
GIt is a version control tool,
that keep tracks of all the changes that we make in our code and store 
them in the "LOCAL" repository
Versions==> any changes that we make in a code creates a new version of it
PROBELM!!!!How to communicate to git???
We can use commands to communicate to GIT
These are unix style commands
Where to give these commands??????
On windows we can give commands on GIT BASH
ON MAC we have TERMINAL where we can give these commands
=================================================================
Lets learn basic UNIX commands
to navigate into our machine
1. Open your gitbash in windows     !! open your TERMINAL
type in whoami ==> will return you  your computer name
2. LEts assume that Temrinal is MR TERMINAL
we want to know where MR terminalis in our computer
so we ask him that using the command
pwd
What does PWD stands for??
(print working directory)
3. Ls  (hey mr terminal can you please tell us that in your current 
location where you are standing
what are the files and folders present over there)
* folders are also called directories
4.we want to ask MR terminal to move into another location from its 
current location
(change the folder)
cd foldername
cd stands change directory
5.HEy mr terminal can you move one folder back ???
cd .. can be used to ask MR terminal to do that
commands that we learned
pwd ==>it gives the current location/folder/directory
ls -->lists out all the content of the current directory/folder
cd foldername ==> change the location to the specified folder name (if the 
folder is not present in the location
where terminal is it will say no such file or directory)
cd .. ==>go back one folder
cd ~ ==> to move back Mr terminal to home directory
